# Data Analysis Project 1 - Exploring Weather Trends

# Abstract:

  The goal of this project is to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. Therefore, I choose the local temperature of Riyadh city that located at Saudi Arabia and analyze it with the global temperature data and compared to it. I extract the data by using SQL workspace from temperature database to exported into CSV. Moreover, I use Microsoft excel to calculate the moving average, make line chart and make observation through data visualizations. The result show that, the both line charts of 10 year moving average temperature global and Riyadh city had hotter weather and increasing in the trend temperature.

# Objectives:

- Analyze local and global temperature data and compared to the temperature trends.
- Extract the data set from the database by using SQL and exported into CSV.
- Creating a line chart visualization that compares Riyadh city temperatures with the global temperatures.
- Making observation based on the line chart visualization.

# Process:

- Data Extraction.
- Open up the CSV.
- Create a line chart (Moving Averages).
- Analysis and Conclusion.
